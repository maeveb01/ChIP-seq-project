# ChIP-seq-project

This project aims to recreate results from the paper by Paul et al. PDR1 overexpression caused by gain of function mutations in the PDR1 promoter underpins azole-resistance in candida glabrata. 
This study objects to identify genes regulated by the PDR1 transcription factor and the consensus sequence of the TF binding site common to all PDR1 binding sites.

The project_report file contains an overall report of the files used and reasoning behind certain steps taken.
